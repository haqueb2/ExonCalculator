# ExonCalculator

This repository contains a shell script that allows you to extract information from the NCBI RefSeq table in the USCS database using the NM accession numbers of the gene/transcript of interest. With this script, you can retrieve the following information: 

* Chromosome
* Transcription start/end position
* Coding sequencing (CDS) start/end position
* Number of exons
* Exon start/end positions
* Exon length (bp)

The schema for the NCBI RefSeq table in USCS can be found [here](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?db=hg19&hgta_group=genes&hgta_track=refSeqComposite&hgta_table=ncbiRefSeqSelect&hgta_doSchema=describe+table+schema).

Please note that the results generated by this code were utilized as part of ongoing projects at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids Hospital) by a student in the Costain lab.

To use this code, follow the instructions below:

### Installation

1. For MacOS, download mysql using Homebrew: `brew install mysql` 
2. Download the shell script file: exon_length.sh

### Usage

Prepare input file with NM accession numbers of genes of interest and save in a plain text file named "nm_numbers.txt", following the same format as the example file. 

Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the shell script and the input file are located. 

In the terminal, execute the following command:

`./exon_length.sh`

The script will process the data, generate results, and save them in an output file named "output.csv".

Details of the columns of the output file: 

Column       | Description
-------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
bin          | Indexing field to speed chromosome range queries
name         | Name of the gene (usually NM number in the input file)
chrom        | Reference sequence chromosome 
strand       | Forward (+) or reverse (-) strand 
txStart      | Transcription start positive (or end position for - strand) 
txEnd        | Transcription end position (or start position for - strand)
cdsStart     | Coding region start (or end position for - strand)
cdsEnd       | Coding region end (or start position for - strand)
exonCount    | Number of exons 
exonStarts   | Semicolon separated exon start positions (or end positions for - strand)
exonEnds     | Semicolon separated exon end positions (or start positions for - strand)
exonLength   | Semicolon separated length of exons in bp 
score        | Score
name2        | Gene name 
cdsStartStat | Status of CDS start annotation (none, unknown, incomplete, or complete)
cdsEndStat   | Status of CDS end annotation (none, unknown, incomplete, or complete)
exonFrames   | Exon frame {0,1,2}, or -1 if no frame for exon
